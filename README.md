This addon acts as a crude translator for addons that have optional support for showing or using price data from MasterMerchant but not Arkadius' Trade Tools.

## Tested Addons
* CraftStore
* AwesomeGuildStore (known bug: items that have no sales can throw UI errors when selecting for listing)
* WritWorthy
